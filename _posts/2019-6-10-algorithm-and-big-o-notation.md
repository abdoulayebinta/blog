In this post we will discuss Big O notation.

## Objectives
- Describe what Big O Notation is
- Simplify Big O Expressions 
- Define "time complexity" and "space complexity"
- Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O Notation

### What's the idea here ?
Imagine we have multiple implementations of the same function. How can we determine which one is the best?

For example, ....

### Why analyze algorithm ?
An **algorithm** is simply a procedure or formula for 
solving a problem. 




## Big O Notation 
- It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about 
 how our code performs
- Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches
